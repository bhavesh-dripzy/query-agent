For centuries, it's been a major European center of art, fashion, gastronomy, and intellectual thought.  From its iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Louvre Museum to its charming streets and vibrant neighborhoods, Paris offers a captivating blend of historical grandeur and modern dynamism.  Its history as the capital stretches back many centuries, having held that position continuously since the late Middle Ages after various earlier capitals throughout French history. Today, it boasts a large population and continues to be a significant global player in politics, economics, and culture.", "The overwhelming scientific consensus is that there is **no safe age to start drinking alcohol**.  While many cultures have traditions around alcohol consumption,  research consistently shows that drinking before the age of 21 significantly increases the risk of numerous negative consequences.  These include alcohol dependence, alcohol-related injuries (like car accidents), brain development problems, and increased risk of certain cancers and other health issues later in life.\n\nThe legal drinking age of 21, while debated, is supported by studies showing it's effective in reducing alcohol-related deaths and injuries among young people.  While some argue that a lower drinking age with education could be beneficial, the current research doesn't support this, emphasizing the significant risks associated with underage drinking outweighing any potential benefits.  The brain continues to develop into the early twenties, making it particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of alcohol during adolescence.  Therefore, abstaining from alcohol until at least age 21 is strongly recommended to minimize long-term health risks."]}
